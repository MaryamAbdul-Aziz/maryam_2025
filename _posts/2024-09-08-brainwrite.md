## Disney Princess Submenu Brainwrite

We decided to focus our submenu on something from our childhoods, our favorite Disney Princesses!

### Brainwrite Submenu

1. Mulan
2. Moana
3. Elsa
4. Anna

### Brainwrite Data

We came up with the idea to use fun facts about each princess

```javascript
var moana_facts = [
    {fact: "Real pigs were used for the voice of Pua", complexity: "O(1)"},
    {fact: "Maui was originally planned to be the protagonist", complexity: "O(1)"},
    {fact: "Moana was Auli'i Cravalho's, the voice of Moana, first acting gig!", complexity: "O(1)"},
    {fact: "You're Welcome was originally Moana's song", complexity: "O(1)"},
    {fact: "Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote a lot of the music for Moana", complexity: "O(1)"},
    {fact: "The name Moana means ocean", complexity: "O(1)"},
];
```
