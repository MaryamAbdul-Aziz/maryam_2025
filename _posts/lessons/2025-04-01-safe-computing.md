## Popcorn Hacks

### Popcorn Hack 1

My bank has access to my name, email, address, SSN, and banking information and money. I use this service to store and manage my money as well as send/receive money remotely. If this information was stolen, I could lose all my money, have my identity stolen, wreck my credit score, and be impersonated online.

### Popcorn Hack 2

If my bank account was locked, rather than click the link within the email, I would go to my browser and go to my banking account through there to verify that the claims within the email are accurate. Then, I would call the number on the back of my debit card to get in contact with my bank and resecure my account. I would never click the link in the email.

### Popcorn Hack 3

Public Wi-Fi networks, which are less secure than private, password protected networks, can be affected by man-in-the-middle attacks, connecting the user to rogue access points and stealing private information. Users can protect themselves by avoiding doing sensitive tasks while connected to public networks or by not connecting to them at all.
