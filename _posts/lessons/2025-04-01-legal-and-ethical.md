## Popcorn Hacks

### Popcorn Hack 1

- If you create something unique (artwork, book, code, etc.) you own the IP
- If you buy something, you own digital access but not the IP
    - If you are given the rights to resell it (authorized by original creator), then you can resell it
    - If you sufficiently transform something under a CC license that allows derivatives, you can resell it as your own

### Popcorn Hack 2

An MIT license would be best for this repository as I do not have or need a patent for my code and I want my code to be available for anyone to use, even if derivatives are not open source. I value open source, collaborative code, so this license makes the most sense for me.
