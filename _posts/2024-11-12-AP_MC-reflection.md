1. What you learned from quiz?
    - From this quiz, I learned more about the format of the MC questions that will be present on the AP exam, such as how the code is formatted in psuedocode and not a specific language, and how variables are declared with the variable name first and an arrow pointing into it with the value of the variable. I also learned that there is a lot of content on the AP exam that we have not yet covered in class, such as information on the impact of computing, accessibility of computers and the Internet, and computer systems and networks, that I will need to review on my own.  

2. What type of questions do you feel you are weak on?
    - I feel weak on questions regarding things not strictly relating to coding, such as vocab terms we have not gone over in class, and different questions on concepts related to how humans use computing.  

3. Corrections on anything you got wrong.
    - 9: Benefits of incremental and iterative development
        - I got this question wrong because I was unsure what incremental and iterative development was. I originally had the correct answer selected, that it could help find code errors, but changed it to implementing algorithmic solutions to otherwise unsolvable problems.  
    - 13: Social media hypotheses
        - I got this question incorrect because I assumed the trend in the graph was minute enough to be considered no change and said that releasing a mobile app left no impact on average number of daily messages when it did.  
    - 14: Comparing loop algorithms
        - I misunderstood how the algorithms worked and thought that both would stop displaying numbers once i became 10 and therefore one would shower fewer digits when this was not the case.  
    - 18: Predicting births with a computer model
        - I misread this question and missed the word least, so I selected an answer that would potentially improve the algorithm instead of hinder it.  
    - 36: Result of computer performing 2 divide by 3
        - I got this question incorrect because I was unsure on the differences between integers and floats. After reading the correct solution, I remembered that integers are whole numbers and floats are decimals, so the correct answer must talk about decimals.  
    - 43: Runtime of algorithm for online retailer
        - I got this question wrong because I did not understand how to go about this problem. The correct solution discusses the number of steps being polynomial, so the algorithm should run in reasonable time.  
    - 46: Infinite loops in undecideable problems
        - I got this question wrong because I was unsure on the definition of an undecideable problem. I originally had the correct answer selected, that an algorithm could not be written for all inputs and programs, but changed it to an answer mentioning a reasonable amount of time.  
    - 57: Generate Happy from Harp and Puppy
        - I got this question wrong because I did not properly read the guidelines posted explaining how the substring function worked. I assumed that the numbers were the indexes of the letters in the strings and didn't realize that the second number was substring length.
