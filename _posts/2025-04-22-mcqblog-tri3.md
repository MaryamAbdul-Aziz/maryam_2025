- 3.8: Iteration: 82% (9/11)

## Reflection

While I scored worse on this MCQ than I have on other practices, I think that I am improving at answering questions. I now know all of the content, and so I am able to understand every vocabulary term and have at least a basic understanding of every topic. 

Additionally, I used a new strategy with this MCQ, where I completed every vocabulary-based question first and the code-based questions after. This allowed me to finish a lot of questions very quickly and spend more time on the code questions.

To study for AP CSP, I completed the entire Khan Academy course to 100% to ensure I had a solid understanding of every topic.

To improve my knowledge, I will:
- Review KA articles on commonly missed topics
- Watch AP Daily Videos
- Consult previous lessons from Period 5 and other periods
- Learn more about the AP CSP Big Ideas:
    - Big Idea 1: Creative Development
        - Learn how to develop programs collaboratively
    - Big Idea 2: Data
        - How data is handled
        - How data can be used to problem solve
    - Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming
        - Learn some of the basics of programming and developing algorithms to use in CPT code
    - Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Networks
        - Computing systems and networks (Internet, internal network)
        - Distributed and parallel computing
    - Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing
        - Societal, economic, and cultural effects
        - Legal and ethical responsibilities
        - Bias, access, and computing
