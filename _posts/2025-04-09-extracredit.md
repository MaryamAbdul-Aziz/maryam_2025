# Key Learnings

## Real World Impact on Cybersecurity Landscape

- Working to catch/end ransomware
- Preventing hackers from getting sensitive information
    - Find sensitive or harmful data and get rid of it
    - Protect others, including civilians
    - Help other people
- Example: Disgruntled senior director was discovered to be stealing company data, emailing proprietary data to competitiors
- Important: Stay curious! Always question the intent and actions of others when you have a reason to do so
- Fight both external and internal threats

## Biggest Threats Today

- Ransomware 
    - Costs $10s of Bs, can threaten businesses
- Foreign adversary threats (China, etc.)
- IPs can get stolen and ruin companies, people’s lives
- AI as cyber weapons
    - Educate others on the attack power of AI tools, stay aware
- 0 day: vulnerability with no patch for it yet
    - Company has a bug, hacker takes advantage of vulnerability, pushes through malicious update to all users
- Phishing attempts
    - Humans can be our weakest link
    - Can make companies very vulnerable, especially when working with serious or vulnerable clients

## The Cybersecurity Landscape: How to Stay Safe

- Use a hacker's mentality to keep yourself protected from vulnerabilities
    - Test systems with these things in mind
    - Ensure that you’re fully protected
    - Look for backdoors, keep an eye out
    - Have legal boundaries (code of conduct)
    - Have recurring checks

- People who can be skilled at coding, know AI
- Next 5-10 years, more hiring in cybersecurity

# Personal Takeaways

I went into this panel not knowing much about the field of cybersecurity, besides general common knowledge. After coming out of this panel, I have discovered that there are many unique paths to cybersecurity. As a senior, this could potentially impact my future career aspirations, as I know now that I could go into cybersecurity even from an unsuspecting field. While I have always known that cyber security is vital to the survival of any person or business, I now understand the different aspects that go into protecting cyberspace and have more respect for the profession.
