# MCQ
Score: 60/67 (89.5%)

![mcq]({{site.baseurl}}/images/tri2-mcq.png)

## Areas where I missed points:

- 1, Design and evaluate computational solutions for a purpose (14/17)
- 2, Develop and implement algorithms (11/13)
- 4, Evaluate and test algorithms and programs (10/12)

## Topic Skill Performance Errors:

- 3.6 Conditionals: 0% (0/1)
- 3.11 Binary Search: 0% (0/1)
- 3.5: Boolean Expressions: 50% (1/2)
- 3.17: Algorithmic Efficiency: 50% (1/2)
- 1.4: Identifying and Correcting Errors: 71% (5/7)
- 2.1: Binary Numbers: 80% (4/5)

## Corrections:

4. Cause of overflow error
- I conflated round-off errors with overflow errors

16. Error in wordList traversal
- I decreased the index only when the target words were found and not when an element is checked

42. Determine if score is within ten points of target
- I got confused reading the Boolean statements and mixed up target and score

47. Requirements for binary search
- I did not know binary searches needed sorted lists to work properly

50. Reasonable time algorithms
- Even though I tried searching for the definition of reasonable time, I still misunderstood that reasonable time *can* be represented by constants and polynomials

62. Which selection statements will display true
- I misunderstood the question and did not realize that since x OR y was equal to true, true would be displayed

67. Error in numOccurrences procedure
- I did not realize I was meant to select 2 answers for this question, and I did not realize that since the target word appeared in the middle of the list, it would incorrectly reset the count to 0.
