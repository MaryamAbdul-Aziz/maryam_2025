    "> Here is how Mort started on this assignment by asking ChatGPT  ... Regarding Python Pandas, what are some data sets that would be good for learning Pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are many data sets that are suitable for learning pandas, depending on your interests and the skills you want to develop. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are some suggestions...\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Titanic Dataset: This is a classic dataset for data analysis and machine learning, and is often used as an introduction to pandas. The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including their demographics, ticket class, and survival status.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Iris Dataset: This is another classic dataset that is often used in machine learning and data analysis courses. The dataset contains information about iris flowers, including their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - NBA Player Stats: This dataset contains information about NBA players, including their stats for various games, their positions, and their salaries. It is a great dataset for learning how to clean and manipulate data using pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Housing Prices Dataset: This dataset contains information about housing prices in a particular city or region, including variables such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and price. It is a great dataset for learning how to manipulate and analyze numerical data using pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - COVID-19 Dataset: This dataset contains information about the COVID-19 pandemic, including the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries in various countries and regions. It is a great dataset for learning how to manipulate and analyze time-series data using pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - World Bank Dataset: This dataset contains information about economic indicators from various countries, such as GDP, population, and poverty rates. It is a great dataset for learning how to manipulate and analyze large datasets using pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- These are just a few examples of the many datasets that are suitable for learning pandas. The best dataset for you will depend on your interests and the specific skills you want to develop.\n",

    "- The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning, and it can be found on various websites and data repositories. Here are a few places where you can find the Titanic dataset...\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Kaggle: The Titanic dataset is available on Kaggle, which is a popular platform for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts. You can download the dataset from the Kaggle website after creating an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - UCI Machine Learning Repository: The Titanic dataset is also available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is a collection of datasets that are commonly used for machine learning research. You can download the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Seaborn library: If you have the Seaborn library installed in your Python environment, you can load the Titanic dataset directly from the library using the following code:\n"

    "- The Titanic dataset is a classic for data analysis and machine learning. We'll use machine learning techniques like Decision Trees and Logistic Regression to predict passenger survival. \n",
    "\n",
    "- [Decision Trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#tree) are a type of model used for both classification and regression. They work by creating a tree-like model of decisions based on the features. For example, in the context of the Titanic dataset, a Decision Tree might make decisions based on features like 'age', 'sex', and 'fare' to predict whether a passenger survived. The tree might first split by 'sex', then for each sex, split by 'age', and so on, creating a tree of decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression) A statistical model used in machine learning for binary classification problems. It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a specific class (e.g., whether a passenger survived in the Titanic dataset). Logistic Regression applies a weighted sum of input features (which are often scaled between 0 and 1 for better performance) and passes the result through a sigmoid function to produce a probability between 0 and 1. The model then uses a threshold (typically 0.5) to classify the input into one of two categories. The sigmoid function is used to convert the weighted sum of input features into a probability score.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After training our models, we'll evaluate their performance using accuracy, the percentage of correct predictions on unseen data."
