    "This example solves the problem of classifying images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to build a neural network that can accurately predict the digit shown in the input image. The problem is a classic machine learning problem and is often used as a benchmark for evaluating different algorithms and models. The example uses a simple neural network with two fully connected layers to achieve high accuracy in classifying the digits."
